  - "README Contributing section uses `uv sync --dev`, `uv run pytest`, and `uv run pytest --cov=...`"
  - "No remaining `pip install -e \".[dev]\"` commands in README.md"
  - "No remaining `python3 -m venv venv` or `source venv/bin/activate` commands in README.md"
  - "`uv` appears before `pip` in all sections where both are mentioned"

## Objective

Update README.md to reflect the uv migration: primary install via `uv tool install`, development workflow via `uv sync`, and test/lint commands via `uv run`. Maintain pip as a documented fallback.

## Context

Read these files before starting:
- `@README.md` — the ONLY file to modify in this plan
- `@.vbw-planning/phases/03-uv-migration-tooling/03-CONTEXT.md` — decision: all three install paths (uv first, pipx second, pip fallback)

Key decisions:
- `uv tool install jarkdown` is the PRIMARY recommended install method
- `pipx install jarkdown` is the alternative for users who prefer pipx
- `pip install jarkdown` is the fallback for users without uv/pipx
- Development uses `uv sync --dev` (replaces venv + pip)
- Commands use `uv run pytest`, `uv run ruff`, etc.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Update Installation section

**Files:** `README.md`

Replace the current "Quick Install (Recommended)" section with three install methods:

**Before:**
```markdown
### Quick Install (Recommended)

Install directly from PyPI with a single command:
```bash
pip install jarkdown
```
```

**After:**
```markdown
### Quick Install (Recommended)

Install as an isolated tool with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):
```bash
uv tool install jarkdown
```

### Alternative: pipx

```bash
pipx install jarkdown
```

### Fallback: pip

```bash
pip install jarkdown
```
```

Keep the "Configuration" and "Getting Your Jira API Token" subsections unchanged.

**Acceptance:** README shows three install methods. `uv tool install` appears first with "(Recommended)" in its heading. `pip install` appears last under "Fallback" heading.

**Commit:** `docs(readme): update install instructions for uv`

### Task 2: Update Developer Setup section

**Files:** `README.md`

Replace the "For Developers (Installing from Source)" section:

**Before:**
```markdown
### For Developers (Installing from Source)
...
2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

**On Windows:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```
```

**After:**
```markdown
### For Developers (Installing from Source)

If you want to contribute to the project or need the latest development version:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chrisbyboston/jarkdown.git
cd jarkdown
```

2. Install dependencies (uv creates and manages the virtual environment automatically):
```bash
uv sync --dev
```

3. Set up your `.env` file as described above
```

Remove the macOS/Linux vs Windows split — `uv sync` is cross-platform, no activation needed. uv manages the venv transparently.

**Acceptance:** Developer setup uses `uv sync --dev`. No `python3 -m venv`, no `source venv/bin/activate`, no `pip install -e`.

**Commit:** `docs(readme): update developer setup for uv`

### Task 3: Update Contributing section

**Files:** `README.md`

Update the Contributing > Development Setup and Testing subsections:

**Development Setup** — replace:
```markdown
2. **Create a virtual environment** and install dependencies:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```
```

With:
```markdown
2. **Install dependencies** (uv manages the virtual environment automatically):
```bash
uv sync --dev
```
```

**Making Changes** — replace test commands:
```markdown
2. **Make your changes** and ensure tests pass:
```bash
pytest
pytest --cov=src/jarkdown --cov-report=term-missing
```
```

With:
```markdown
2. **Make your changes** and ensure tests pass:
```bash
uv run pytest
uv run pytest --cov=src/jarkdown --cov-report=term-missing
```
```

**Testing** section — replace:
```markdown
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src/jarkdown --cov-report=term-missing

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_cli.py
```
```

With:
```markdown
```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Run with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=src/jarkdown --cov-report=term-missing

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest tests/test_cli.py
```
```

**Acceptance:** All `pytest` commands in Contributing section are prefixed with `uv run`. Dev setup uses `uv sync --dev`. No `pip install` remains in Contributing section.

**Commit:** `docs(readme): update contributing section for uv`

## Verification

```bash
# No pip install commands remain (except as documented fallback)
grep -n "pip install" README.md  # should only appear in the "Fallback: pip" section
# No venv creation commands remain
grep -n "python3 -m venv" README.md  # should return nothing
grep -n "source venv/bin/activate" README.md  # should return nothing
# uv appears in install, dev setup, and contributing
grep -c "uv " README.md  # should be >= 10 occurrences
```

## Success Criteria

- Three install methods documented: uv (primary), pipx (alternative), pip (fallback)
- Developer setup uses `uv sync --dev` — no manual venv creation
- Contributing section uses `uv run pytest` for all test commands
- uv appears before pip in every section where both are mentioned
- No stale pip-based commands remain (except the explicit pip fallback install)
