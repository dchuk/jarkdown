## Key Decisions
| Decision | Date | Rationale |
|----------|------|-----------|
| Time tracking in frontmatter | 2026-02-17 | Keeps data queryable by frontmatter parsers |
| Environment always as body section | 2026-02-17 | Consistent rendering, preserves HTML formatting |
| Issue links grouped by relationship type | 2026-02-17 | Most scannable for issues with many links |
| Worklogs as full table | 2026-02-17 | Matches "complete offline archive" core value |
| All fields always present (complete schema) | 2026-02-17 | YAML null / "None" — consistent, grep-able |
| Cached field metadata per domain | 2026-02-17 | 24h TTL, XDG-compliant, graceful degradation |
| .jarkdown.toml + CLI overrides | 2026-02-17 | Config file for defaults, CLI flags for per-run override |
| Best-effort ADF Markdown | 2026-02-17 | Full node coverage, Markdown-only output |
| Type-aware + generic fallback rendering | 2026-02-17 | Schema-based dispatch with shape inspection fallback |
